# wordle-clone

A Clone of the popular NYT game Wordle

Created during my ICS4U1 class in Grade 12, using Python.
From this project I learned to:

- Read, write, and update csv files
- Validate inputs by comparing them to csv file contents
- Use csv files to keep a track log of users
- Keep track of the users past attempts and display them accordingly.
